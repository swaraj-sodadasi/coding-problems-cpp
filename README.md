## 📚 What is DSA?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** are the backbone of efficient programming.  
- **Data Structures** organize and store data (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs).
- **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures to solve problems (e.g., searching, sorting, dynamic programming).

Mastering DSA helps you write optimized, scalable, and robust code!

## 🏆 Repository Structure

Problems are categorized by difficulty:

| Level      | Description                                         | Symbol |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Basic**  | Simple problems to get started with C++ and DSA     | 🟢     |
| **Medium** | Intermediate challenges to deepen your understanding | 🟡     |
| **Advanced**| Complex problems for expert-level practice         | 🔴     |

Each problem allows **dynamic input from the user** so you can test with different cases!
